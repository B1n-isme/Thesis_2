BOHB (Bayesian Optimization HyperBand): 
- bayesian optimization (efficiency) + hyperband (resource adaptiveness)
-> require careful evaluate config

HEBO (Heteroscedastic Evolutionary Bayesian Optimization)
- suit with noisy data
-> hard to config 

OptunaSearch 
- TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator): a robust Bayesian optimization technique
- CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy): excellent for more complex, non-convex, or ill-conditioned search spaces.
-> start with TPE

Suggestion:
1. Start with Random Search or HyperOptSearch: Run a small number of trials (e.g., 20-30) to get a feel for the search space and establish a baseline.
2. Move to BOHB or Optuna (with TPE/HyperBand Pruner): These are often my first choices for serious tuning due to their balance of performance and efficiency. HEBO is a strong alternative if you anticipate a noisy or complex landscape.
