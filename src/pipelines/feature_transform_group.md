Of course. This is an excellent list of variables. As a senior AI researcher, I can help you categorize these and apply a clear, consistent methodology for transformation. Incorrectly transforming these features is one of the most common ways a forecasting project can go wrong.

Here is a breakdown of your exogenous variables, categorized with my recommendations. The guiding principle is this: **transform raw price/level series that are non-stationary, but preserve the inherent meaning of derived indicators.**

---

### Group 1: Raw Price & Price-Like Cross-Market Data
These variables represent a direct price, index level, or exchange rate. If the ADF test confirms they are non-stationary (which they almost certainly will be), they are prime candidates for the log return transformation to make them stationary.

**Recommendation:** **Apply log returns** if the ADF test shows non-stationarity.

* `Gold_Price`
* `Oil_Crude_Price`
* `Oil_Brent_Price`
* `DJI` (Dow Jones Industrial Average)
* `GSPC` (S&P 500)
* `IXIC` (NASDAQ Composite)
* `NYFANG` (NYSE FANG+ Index)
* `EM_ETF` (Emerging Markets ETF, price-based)
* `DXY` (US Dollar Index)
* `EURUSD` (Euro/USD exchange rate)
* `Gold_Share` (Assuming this is a price-based value, if it's a ratio it belongs in Group 4)

### Group 2: Unbounded Blockchain & CBBI Indicators
These are fundamental metrics of the Bitcoin network or complex price-derived models. They represent levels, counts, or values that are non-stationary and often exhibit strong trends (e.g., hash rate generally increases over time). Transforming them to their rate of change is essential.

**Recommendation:** **Apply log returns** if the ADF test shows non-stationarity. This is a very appropriate transformation for these types of fundamental series.

* `btc_trading_volume`
* `active_addresses_blockchain`
* `hash_rate_blockchain`
* `miner_revenue_blockchain`
* `difficulty_blockchain`
* `estimated_transaction_volume_usd_blockchain`
* `PiCycle_cbbi`
* `RUPL_cbbi`
* `RHODL_cbbi`
* `Puell_cbbi`
* `2YMA_cbbi`
* `Trolololo_cbbi`
* `MVRV_cbbi`
* `ReserveRisk_cbbi`
* `Woobull_cbbi`

### Group 3: Trend-Following Technical Indicators
These are derived from price but are still designed to follow its non-stationary trend. **This is a special case.** While log returns would make them stationary, it often destroys their primary signal, which is their *level relative to the price*. A better approach is to engineer relational features. However, if you must transform them directly, log returns is the method to achieve stationarity.

**Recommendation:** **Apply log returns with caution**, as it may obscure the intended signal. The *best practice* is to create relational features (e.g., `(price - indicator) / price`). If you must choose, log returns will achieve stationarity.

* `btc_sma_5`, `btc_ema_5`, `btc_sma_14`, `btc_ema_14`, `btc_sma_21`, `btc_ema_21`, `btc_sma_50`, `btc_ema_50`
* `btc_bb_high`, `btc_bb_low`, `btc_bb_mid` (The Bollinger Bands themselves are trend-following)
* `btc_macd` (The MACD line is unbounded and non-stationary)
* `btc_macd_signal` (The signal line is a moving average of the MACD line, also non-stationary)
* `btc_atr_14` (Average True Range is a measure of volatility but is often trended and non-stationary)

### Group 4: Oscillators, Spreads, Ratios, and Bounded Indicators
These indicators are *designed* to be stationary or mean-reverting. They oscillate around a central value or within a specific range. **You should NOT apply differencing or log returns to these**, even if an ADF test fails on a specific subsample of your data. A failed test on these often indicates a prolonged market regime. Transforming them would destroy their intended meaning.

**Recommendation:** **Use the raw values.** Do not transform them based on an ADF test.

* `btc_sma_14_50_diff`, `btc_ema_14_50_diff` (Spreads/differences are often stationary)
* `btc_sma_14_50_ratio` (Ratios are often stationary)
* `btc_sma_14_slope`, `btc_ema_14_slope`, etc. (Slopes are already a form of change/momentum)
* `btc_close_ema_21_dist`, `btc_close_ema_21_dist_norm` (Distances to a moving average are mean-reverting)
* `btc_rsi_14` (Classic bounded oscillator: 0-100)
* `btc_macd_diff` (This is the MACD histogram, which oscillates around zero)
* `btc_bb_width` (Bollinger Band width is a volatility measure that tends to be mean-reverting)
* `Confidence_cbbi`
* `btc_volatility_index`, `Gold_Volatility`, `Oil_Volatility`, `CBOE_Volatility` (Volatility itself is generally considered mean-reverting)

### Group 5: Sentiment & Categorical Indicators
These are typically scores, often bounded (e.g., -1 to 1, or 0 to 100), or represent a proportion of discussion. Similar to oscillators, their *level* is what's important, not their rate of change.

**Recommendation:** **Use the raw values.** Do not apply log returns.

* `Fear Greed` (Typically a bounded 0-100 index)
* `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`
* `bullish_sentiment`, `bearish_sentiment`
* And all other `..._sentiment` variables.
