Of course. Based on the results you've provided, here is an analysis of your Bitcoin price forecasting project from the perspective of a senior AI researcher.

### Executive Summary

Your results provide a fascinating and somewhat counter-intuitive look into the challenges of forecasting Bitcoin prices. The key takeaway is that **model complexity is not a guarantee of forecasting accuracy, especially as the time horizon increases.** For short-term (7-day) forecasts, complex deep learning models like **TSMixerx** show a distinct advantage. However, for longer horizons (14 and 30 days), their performance degrades significantly, and simpler, more robust models like **SARIMAX** deliver surprisingly superior and stable results. The dramatic failure of most machine learning and deep learning models at the 14-day horizon is a critical finding, suggesting extreme sensitivity to specific market regimes or data characteristics within that forecast window.

### How does predictive accuracy change as the horizon increases?

Predictive accuracy degrades non-linearly and, in many cases, erratically as the forecast horizon increases.

* **7-Day Horizon:** This is where the sophisticated models shine. The deep learning model **TSMixerx** (`MAPE: 2.14%`) and the gradient boosting model **CatBoost** (`MAPE: 2.87%`) are the top performers, suggesting they are adept at capturing complex, short-term patterns from your multivariate dataset.
* **14-Day Horizon:** The results here are anomalous. Most models, particularly the complex ones like CatBoost, LightGBM, and TFT, experience a catastrophic drop in accuracy. For instance, CatBoost's MAPE explodes from `2.87%` to `14.44%`. Counter-intuitively, the statistical model **SARIMAX** and the ML model **XGBoost** deliver their best performance at this horizon. This inversion is highly unusual and points to a potential data anomaly or a market regime shift that brittle models failed to handle.
* **30-Day Horizon:** Performance is mixed. Many models that failed at 14 days (e.g., CatBoost) see their accuracy recover somewhat, though not to their 7-day levels. However, the simpler statistical models, especially **SARIMAX** (`MAPE: 2.56%`), remain top-tier performers, outperforming most of the deep learning lineup.

The error growth is not straightforwardly linear or polynomial; it's **volatile and model-dependent**. The spike at 14 days for most models suggests that error growth can be abrupt and unpredictable, which is characteristic of highly volatile financial assets like Bitcoin.

### Which models are more robust to performance degradation?

Based on your results, **robustness is inversely correlated with complexity.**

* **Most Robust:** **SARIMAX** is the clear winner in terms of robustness. It provides reasonable performance at 7 days and becomes the top-performing model at the 14-day and 30-day horizons. Its ability to maintain low error across all horizons is a significant finding. This suggests that for Bitcoin, capturing the fundamental time series components (like trend and seasonality) that SARIMAX is designed for provides a more stable foundation for long-term forecasts than learning complex, high-dimensional interactions that may be transient.

* **Moderately Robust:** **NBEATSx** and **TSMixerx** show a more "graceful" and expected degradation. Their error increases with the horizon but doesn't explode unpredictably like other complex models. This makes them more reliable among the deep learning options, even if they aren't the best performers at longer horizons.

* **Least Robust (Brittle):** **TFT, CatBoost, LightGBM, and BiTCN** prove to be very brittle. Their exceptional performance at 7 days completely reverses at longer horizons, especially at the 14-day mark. The **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** is a notable example; despite its sophisticated architecture designed for long horizons, it has the worst performance at 30 days (`MAPE: 46.26%`) and is computationally expensive, making it impractical for this task.

### Do Transformer architectures provide a tangible advantage?

The evidence is **mixed and largely unconvincing.**

While the **TSMixerx** model (a lightweight MLP-based architecture, not a canonical Transformer) delivered the best 7-day forecast, the true Transformer models did not live up to their theoretical promise of capturing long-range dependencies effectively.

* **TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer):** Failed spectacularly. Its accuracy decay was the most severe of all models, directly contradicting the hypothesis that it would be superior for long-horizon forecasting. Its massive computational time (`>12,000s`) combined with poor performance makes it a poor choice.
* **iTransformer:** Delivered mediocre performance across all horizons, showing no clear advantage over simpler statistical or machine learning models.

Your results suggest that for this specific forecasting problem, the overhead and complexity of canonical Transformer architectures may be a hindrance rather than a help, possibly leading to overfitting on spurious correlations in the training data.

### Is there a model complexity vs. horizon trade-off?

Yes, absolutely. Your results present a classic case of a **complexity-vs-horizon trade-off.**

* **Short Horizon (7 days):** Higher complexity wins. The intricate pattern recognition capabilities of **TSMixerx** and **CatBoost** give them a clear edge.
* **Longer Horizons (14 & 30 days):** Simplicity and robustness prevail. As the forecast horizon extends, the signal-to-noise ratio in financial data typically drops, making it harder to predict. Complex models, which may have overfitted to the noise and transient patterns in the short-term, fail to generalize. In contrast, a simpler model like **SARIMAX**, which relies on more fundamental and persistent statistical properties of the series, provides more reliable and stable forecasts.

This demonstrates a crucial principle in time series forecasting: a model must match the complexity of the underlying signal. For longer-term Bitcoin forecasting, the persistent, lower-frequency signals captured by **SARIMAX** appear to be more valuable than the high-frequency, complex interactions learned by the deep learning models.
